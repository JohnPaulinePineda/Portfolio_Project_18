This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_18/) implements Univariate Filters in selecting informative predictors for a modelling problem. Using the Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and Naive Bayes model structures, feature selection methods applied in the analysis included the P-Value Threshold with Bonferroni Correction and Correlation Cutoff. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying various Univariate Filters were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) metric. The AUROC values were compared to those of the baseline models which made use of the full data without any form of feature selection, or implemented a model-specific feature selection process.
